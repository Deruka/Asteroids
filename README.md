This is a copy of Asteroids made with a guidance from the online course at https://boot.dev/. I might expand this project in the future to add additional functions, but focus more on learning the fundamentals as of now. 

You can shoot the asteroids with Spacebar, move with W,A,S,D and the game closes on contact.
